Running Balsa

    A few environment variables must be set first:

    PATH=${PATH}:${BALSAHOME}/bin

    Three additional environment variables are significant to
    Balsa. These are:

    BALSAHOME is used by the scheme interpreter to find scheme files
    and by the `make install' operation as a installation root.
    BALSAPATH is a list of directories to search for breeze and sbreeze
    files whilst using Balsa.

    All of BALSAHOME and BALSAPATH should be unset by default.
    Their main use is to temporarily override the installation directory
    position.

    Balsa source files can be compiled to breeze with the command:
    
    balsa-c <src-file>.balsa
